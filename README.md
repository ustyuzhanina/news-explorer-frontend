## Technologies used:
ES6, HTML5, CSS3, Figma, GIT, Webpack


## Launch instructions:
- Download this repository __'git clone'__
- Install all required dependancies __'npm i'__
- The project has minor Javascript scripting to animate all buttons and make the viewer familiar with the website's basic functionality. Just click on any button you wish without filling in the forms and you will see how the webpage changes after logging in.

P.S. Search results area is now fixed in the design ... looking forward to the last diploma stage - Javascript.
